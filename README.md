# Hello-World
A place to share ideas with the world
I have a **PhD** in Med. Science from **Ben-Gurion University**.
As a *Post-doc* I study ==balnce and gait== in **healthy adults** and **people after stroke**.
I use **biomechanics** and **Data analytics** to answer questions related to **motor control** issues in *preturbed* and *unpreturbed* gait.
